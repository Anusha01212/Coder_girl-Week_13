    "KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression problem. KNN means k-Nearest Neighbors. KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or won’t vote.The training phase of K-nearest neighbor classification is much faster compared to other classification algorithms. There is no need to train a model for generalization, That is why KNN is known as the simple and instance-based learning algorithm. KNN can be useful in case of nonlinear data. It can be used with the regression problem. Output value for the object is computed by the average of k closest neighbors value."
